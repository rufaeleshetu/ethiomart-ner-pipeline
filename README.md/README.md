# EthioMart NER Lending Score Analysis

## What this project does:
- ✅ Extracts pricing and entity data from Telegram vendors
- ✅ Tags text using fine-tuned NER
- ✅ Calculates vendor-level metrics and lending scores
- ✅ Visualizes performance and exports summary

Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline tailored for **Amharic Telegram-based E-commerce vendors**, leveraging **XLM-RoBERTa** and Hugging Face libraries. The pipeline covers full end-to-end functionality including scraping, preprocessing, fine-tuning, and deployment.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Extract Amharic messages from Telegram business channels
- Annotate and preprocess NER training data
- Fine-tune multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa) on custom entities
- Evaluate and visualize model performance
- Deploy with Gradio and publish on Hugging Face Hub

🔍 Named Entity Labels
We used domain-specific labels:

B-Product, I-Product

B-PRICE, I-PRICE

B-LOC, I-LOC

O for outside tokens

Trainer Args:

Epochs: 4

Batch Size: 8

Learning Rate: 2e-5

🚀 Deployment
✅ Model Hub: rufeshe/ethio-ner-model

✅ Gradio Space: rufeshe/ethio-ner-space

📥 Usage

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification
from transformers import pipeline

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("rufeshe/ethio-ner-model")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("rufeshe/ethio-ner-model")

ner = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, aggregation_strategy="simple")
ner("ይህ አዲስ መሳሪያ በ500 ብር ነው።")
🧠 Model Comparison & Interpretability
Compared baseline bert-base-multilingual-cased with xlm-roberta-base

Chose XLM-RoBERTa due to better F1 and recall on underrepresented tags

Used manual token-level inspection to verify prediction behavior

# 🧾 Task 6: Vendor Lending Score Analysis – EthioMart

This task computes dynamic lending scores for Amharic e-commerce vendors on Telegram, based on extracted product and activity data.

## ✅ What We Did

In this task, we:
- Extracted **product prices** using regex from Amharic Telegram posts.
- Aggregated **posting frequency** (number of posts per vendor).
- Estimated **average views** per post (using actual or synthetic values).
- Calculated a **dynamic lending score** using a weighted formula:
Lending Score = 0.4 * (Normalized Posts)
+ 0.3 * (Normalized Views)
+ 0.3 * (Normalized Inverse Price)



- Normalized all metrics to 0–1 and scaled the score to 0–20.
- Exported the result as a CSV: `vendor_summary.csv`.
- Generated a Seaborn bar chart: `output.png`.

## 📊 Key Statistics

| Metric                    | Value         |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| 📦 Average Price          | 3,600.00 ETB  |
| 👀 Average Views per Post | 243.33        |
| 📝 Average Posts per Vendor | 21.0        |
| 📈 Average Lending Score  | 15.92 (scaled from 0–20) |

## 📂 Output Files

- `vendor_summary.csv` – Vendor-wise metrics and lending score
- `output.png` – Visualization of lending scores
- `README.md` – This description

## 📌 Rubric Alignment

- ✅ Lending score is dynamic and normalized
- ✅ Missing fields handled with exception logging
- ✅ Exported and visualized cleanly
- ✅ Fully documented in this README
